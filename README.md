# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## OVERVIEW
### Pewlett-Hackard is getting ready to offer retirement packages and they want to be prepared by identifying how many employees are eligible and what positions they may need to fill as a result. They provided me with 6 files of data which I used to create a database with PostgreSQL and pgADmin. Initially, a created an entity relationship(ERG) diagram to highlight the tables relationship to each other and have for reference while completing the analysis.

## RESULTS
### *90,398 employees are eligible for the retirement package. The majority of these employees are either Senior Engineers or Senior Staff. This is a very large number of Senior employees and could potentially result in multiple open positions if Pewlett-Hackard is unable to mentor current employees to fill some of them.

## SUMMARY
### Pewlett-Hackard has a lot of work to do. In order to provide a more accurate analysis, it would be beneficial to exclude those no longer employed from the retirement eligible list. The mentoring eligible employee table was created from a narrow range of birthdays. Adding a few years may increase the number of mentors available and help prepare for the 'silver tsunami'. Additional defining of titles and roles may be helpful as well.
